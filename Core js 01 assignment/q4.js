 Q4.Describe the usage of the comma operator in JavaScript and provide an example.



ans :- The comma operator in JavaScript is used to combine multiple expressions into a single expression. 
It evaluates each of its operands from left to right and returns the value of the rightmost operand. 
While the individual expressions are evaluated, the comma operator is often used when you want to 
include multiple expressions in a location that expects a single expression.
